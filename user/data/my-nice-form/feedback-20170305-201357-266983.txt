message: Hi my name is Deanna Brady and I just wanted to send you a quick note here instead of calling you. I came to your Pteralix | DevOps for Real page and noticed you could have a lot more hits. I have found that the key to running a successful website is making sure the visitors you are getting are interested in your website topic. There is a company that you can get keyword targeted visitors from and they let you try their service for free for 7 days. I managed to get over 300 targeted visitors to day to my site. http://lis.ovh/is
