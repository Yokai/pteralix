My friend has suggested to contact a make a website ebay at 999webdesign.com (here is URL if you are lazy to type it, http://999webdesign.com/ - direct link - &quot;WEBSITES FOR SALE&quot;) - I hope it can work! It looks like they are making good MONEY MAKING SITES. Would you share your opinion and experience?
