message: I am not an Alaska native, nor do I live in Alaska. I¡¯m from Wisconsin, but Alaska holds a special place for me ¨C Denali National Park in particular. Now, while I want for more to do than to speak out here, or donate, I will say this. The science is against this. The destruction of the King Salmon runs would be immense and drastic. It would destroy a not insignificant portion of some of the most beautiful country on Earth. The economics are against it ¨C job creation, while certainly a plus, is extremely temporary. Our own Governor Walker wishes to allow mining near the Bad River in Wisconsin, citing job creation as a significant motive. Jobs like this are temporary ¨C the mine will die, and the dam, yesterday¡¯s technology, will bring ruin to precious biodiversity, and is already obsolete. There are other, better ways. The dam must not be built.<br />  633443 http://30m55.alicheapbuy.com
