message: A Biological Masterpiece, But Subject to Many Ills <br />  The human foot is a biological masterpiece. Its strong, flexible, and functional design enables it to do its job well and without complaintâ€”if you take care of it and don&#039;t take it for granted. <br />  healthThe foot can be compared to a finely tuned race car, or a space shuttle, vehicles whose function dictates their design and structure. And like them, the human foot is complex, containing within its relatively small size 26 bones (the two feet contain a quarter of all the bones in the body), 33 joints, and a network of more than 100 tendons, muscles, and ligaments, to say nothing of blood vessels and nerves. <br />  &lt;a href=https://www.cialissansordonnancefr24.com/prix-du-cialis-20/&gt;https://www.cialissansordonnancefr24.com/prix-du-cialis-20/&lt;/a&gt;
