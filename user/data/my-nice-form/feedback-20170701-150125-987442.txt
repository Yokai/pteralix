message: I&#039;ve visited themeforest before and then I stumbled upon some intriguing pages, such as this one: https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress/?term=movies+of+gay+college+s+having+sex+two+of+our+new+emo+fellows+beat+the As you can tell there aren&#039;t any themes on that niche but nonetheless the page exists - with a title and some text, etc. What exactly are they planning to do? And why would they even try? I&#039;m confused.
