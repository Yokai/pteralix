message: How do you do?.. <br />   <br />  Understanding Giclee Prints for avant-garde home wall decor. <br />   <br />  Giclee (zhee-klay) - The French word &quot;giclee&quot; is a feminine word that means a spurt of liquid. The word may have been derived from the French verb &quot;gicler&quot; meaning &quot;to squirt&quot;. <br />   <br />  Images are developed from high resolution digital scans and printed with archival quality inks onto various substrates including canvas and photo-base paper.  <br />   <br />  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gicl%C3%A9e -  Giclee is a neologism coined in 1991 by printmaker Jack Duganne for fine art digital prints made on inkjet printers. The name formerly applied to fine art prints created on Iris printers in a process made-up in the late 1980s but has since come to mean any inkjet print. It is often used by artists to describe high quality printing.  <br />   <br />  Giclee prints are helpful to artists who do not find it reasonable to mass produce their work, but want to reproduce their art on-demand. <br />   <br />  Numerous examples of giclee prints can be found in New York City at the http://www.metmuseum.org/ - Metropolitan Museum, the http://www.metmuseum.org/ - Museum of Modern Art and the http://chelseagallerymap.com/ - Chelsea Galleries. Recent auctions of giclee prints have fetched $10,800 for Annie Leibovitz, $9,600 for Chuck Close, and $22,800 for Wolfgang Tillmans.  <br />   <br />  https://www.etsy.com/il-en/listing/499149594/giclee-art-print-n-37-contemporary-art -  Her—É and now you can order authentic Giclee poster at Etsy shops. <br />   <br />  Bye-Bye... and Best Regards
