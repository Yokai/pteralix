message: I&#039;ve been interested in data and analytics for a long, long time. As a ten-year-old, I remember creating Excel spreadsheets with my dad for his annual Fantasy Football pool. By the time I was 16, I was building Pivot Tables with my cell phone bill to figure out who I texted the most. (I promise I had other hobbies.) <br />   <br />  Since then, I&#039;ve learned how much more there is to data analysis besides Pivot Tables and Excel. There&#039;s a whole world of analytics out there -- and I&#039;ve barely scratched the surface.There&#039;s always more to learn, so I&#039;ve made it my mission to learn as much as possible about analytics by talking with people and, of course, consuming as much content as I can online. Here are my favorite go-to resources for continuing my marketing analytics education. <br />   <br />  &lt;b&gt;1) The KISSmetrics Blog &lt;/b&gt; <br />   <br />  The KISSmetrics blog is a great resource to learn about marketing analytics, testing, and experimenting with your data.

In this section, you can search or browse through thousands of common analytics questions and skim through answers from analytics experts. Many of the most respected analytics experts are following and answering topics related to analytics on Quora.

I find the advice on here very actionable, and I think it&#039;d be helpful for readers at every level. <br />   <br />  Moz <br />   <br />  &lt;b&gt;9) Predictive Analytics World Conferences&lt;/b&gt; <br />   <br />  Predictive Analytics World is a series of conferences around the world that are focused on analytics. Each event in each different city is focused on its own theme. For example, in Chicago there are two simultaneous events: one focused on manufacturing and one focused on business. In Washington, D.C., the conference is focused on how government agencies use data analysis. Many of the other conferences are focused on business in general and can appeal to anyone interested in learning more about data analysis and upcoming trends in predictive analytics. <br />   <br />  Predictive Analytics World <br />   <br />  BONUS: HubSpot&#039;s &quot;How to Use Excel&quot; Blog Post <br />   <br />  While this is a single blog post rather than an ongoing publication, I still think worth including here as a helpful resource. I get asked about my favorite Excel tips all the time, so I finally decided to compile some of the most common ones into a single blog post listing 14 simple Excel shortcuts, tips, and tricks. <br />   <br />  &lt;b&gt;Excel Tips &lt;/b&gt; <br />   <br />  What are your favorite resources for learning more about analytics?
