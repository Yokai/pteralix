When most of us might be looking to lighten the load, he&#039;s piling on the ambition. <br />  The serial entrepreneur&#039;s latest gambit is to fly people around the Moon. Two wealthy individuals have apparently lodged significant deposits with his SpaceX company to make this journey. <br />  We have no idea who they are, just that these space tourists &lt;a href=http://fun2news.com/en/news/211-marasmatic-photos-that-will-do&gt;The best works of the photo contest Hasselblad Masters Awards 2016&lt;/a&gt; include &quot;nobody from Hollywood&quot;. <br />  That Mr Musk should announce his intention to carry out a Moon loop should not really be a surprise; such a venture is on the natural path to deep-space exploration and colonisation - his stated end goals. <br />  What does take the breath away is the timeline. <br />  He&#039;s talking about doing this journey in late 2018, in hardware that has not yet even flown. That&#039;s Elon for you.
