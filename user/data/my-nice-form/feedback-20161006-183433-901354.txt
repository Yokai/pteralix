message: Hi my name is Patricia and I just wanted to drop you a quick note here instead of calling you. I came to your Pteralix | DevOps for Real website and noticed you could have a lot more visitors. I have found that the key to running a popular website is making sure the visitors you are getting are interested in your subject matter. There is a company that you can get keyword targeted traffic from and they let you try the service for free for 7 days. I managed to get over 300 targeted visitors to day to my site. http://www.v-diagram.com/2sv1p     - Unsubscribe here: http://misdivi.de/e8
