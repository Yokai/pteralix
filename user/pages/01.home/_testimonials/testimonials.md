      content: &quot; &#34;Gets things done&#34;, is in one phrase how I would describe Cads.I have had the opportunity to report to him while working at ooyala, in his position as Senior Engineering Management, and my first impression after I explained the struggles I was going through, was actually great; quoting him &#34;remember you're no longer working with systems, but with people&#34;.  <br/>Although things like this may seem obvious, guidance and consistency make him a great mentor in addition to a very trustable and consistent manager, a pleasure to work with, always smiling and open to listen to what you have to say, providing leadership and opening clear channels of communication.<br/>  I'd work again with Cads at any time, and would highly recommend him as a Senior Engineering Manager.

      content: Cads ran the release and tools team for me at Ooyala. He did a fantastic job of managing both an onshore and an offshore team and was the primary evangelist in the company for driving us to a true CICD process. Cads is someone that you can count on to effectively lead his teams and to get the job done.

      content: I worked with Cads for almost two years at Ooyala. Cads did a phenomenal job stabilizing Ooyala's release process, developing and driving stability and quality metrics, and helping communicate effectively both within the org and with external partners. Cads hands-on coding and integration skills made him an effective change-agent building tools and working with engineering teams to define and implement process. Cads managed to keep calm and carry on during incidents and under extreme pressure. His can-do attitude and special brand of humor made him a natural leader and a huge asset for the entire team. I would be delighted to get the opportunity to work with him again in the future."
